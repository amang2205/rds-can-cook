title: Brasov-style savoury crepes
category: desserts
shortdescription: The Romanian * clatite * are similar both in terms of ingrediants and looks with the French crepe. However, Romanian clatites are commonly stuffed with either season vegetables, meat or various sweets. This recipe is a typical Transylvanian-style clatite, known in some places of Romania as 'clatite brasovene'
ingredients:
  350g wheat flour
  500ml cold milk
  500g Cottage cheese
  200g sour cream
  50g butter
  5 eggs
  200g powdered sugar
  lemon peel
  100g raisins
  salt
  optionally, some vanilla essence
directions:
  First, mix 3 eggs until they form a bit of foam on top.
  Add the butter and around a small spoon of salt. 
  Add 250ml of milk and steer.
  Don't worry if the butter wasn't warm enough yet and small lumps have formed - they'll melt in the pan.
  ** Gradually ** add the flour and continoulsy steer.
  Add the remaining 250ml of milk.
  If you want some additional flavor, add the vanilla essence.
  Your mixture is now ready for the crepes. 
  It is preferable to leave the mixture for around 15 minutes in the fridge; this helps the mixture thicken a bit.
  In the meantime, get a pan hot enough to fry your crepes. I usually prefer to use just a bit of butter to grease the pan.
  Use a ladle to pour the mixture in the pan; it only takes 30 seconds or so for the crepe to be properly fried on a side. Make sure you fry it on both sides. Stack the fried crepes on a plate.
  Also, make sure you start on of Richard Campbells' podcasts: this is the most time consuming and boring part of preparing crepes.
  Finally, once all your crepes were fried, it's time to get back in business - we'll first prepare the cottage cheese based filling.
  In a bowl, mix the cottage cheese, the sour cream, sugar and just a tip of salt.
  Add the lemon peel too.
  Break and mix 2 eggs and steer everything well until you get a nice and smooth (homogeneous) cream. Certainly, the mixture will be rather thick.
  Add the raisins.
  Using a large spoon, take two spoons on the new mixture and use it to start your first filled crepe.
  Start rolling your crepe; the way I prefer to do it is that I fold two sides first, then the bottom and top part and then finally roll the crepe. A small crepe will result.
  Repeat the process for your remaining crepes, but make sure not to use the entire mixture - you will want to leave some for the end.
  Pick a heat-resistent bowl and generously fill its sides with butter and powdered sugar.
  Fill the bowl with your rolled crepes.
  On top of all the crepe, pour the remaining mixture.
  Leave for around 35-40' in the oven to bake at around 180 degrees Celsius. 
  Once the topping is brown, it's ready to be enjoyed
